Netflix Dashboard - Power BI Project

HeyðŸ‘‹  
This is one of my favorite Power BI projects where I analyzed Netflix's content to discover fun and useful insights like:

- What are the most common genres on Netflix?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- How has the number of movies and shows changed over the years?
- And what kind of ratings are most common?

The dashboard is fully interactive 
â€” you can filter by **year**, **country**, and **type** (Movie or TV Show), and explore:
- Top genres and how often they appear
- Content distribution by country
- Release year trends
- Rating breakdown
- Drill-through to see detailed info about each genre
