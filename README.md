# 🎬 Netflix Dashboard - Power BI Project

Hey there! 👋  
This is one of my favorite Power BI projects where I analyzed Netflix's content to discover fun and useful insights like:

- What are the most common genres on Netflix?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- How has the number of movies and shows changed over the years?
- And what kind of ratings are most common?

## 📊 About the Dashboard

The dashboard is fully interactive — you can filter by **year**, **country**, and **type** (Movie or TV Show), and explore:

- Top genres and how often they appear
- Content distribution by country
- Release year trends
- Rating breakdown
- Drill-through to see detailed info about each genre

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- **Power BI** for data modeling, DAX, and visual storytelling
- **Excel** for cleaning and preparing the data
